## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'digital ghost'—a piece of data or AR layer left behind in a soon-to-be-demolished location that tells a personal story.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of a building (like the Avalon) experiencing its final days, sensing the scans and preparations for its end.
- Draft a text message thread between Jasmine and a friend after a fight with Eli, exploring communication gaps and unsaid things.
- Write a 'urban myth' for the neighborhood about the Avalon's supposed tunnel, showing how community lore is created and sustained.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a conceptual 'Memory Mapping' app interface that allows users to tag physical locations with digital memories, photos, or voice notes, visualizing how a place's story layers over time.
- Outline a system for 'Ethical Digital Preservation' of community spaces facing demolition—what data (stories, sounds, textures, layouts) should be saved, and in what format, to truly capture its essence?
