The scene is a narrow, rain-slicked alley in a rapidly gentrifying city district, where futuristic augmented-reality advertisements and construction cranes loom over historic, graffiti-tagged buildings that are fading like ghosts; spectral echoes of past residents and old neon signs flicker amidst the physical decay and digital overlay. In the atmospheric style of Simon Stålenhag and Beeple, blending hyper-detailed urban realism with ethereal digital decay and poignant narrative. Book cover framing, centered and intimate composition with a dramatic low-angle shot looking up at the siblings against the towering, conflicting cityscape. Cinematic chiaroscuro lighting with pockets of cold, electric blue and neon magenta from the digital elements contrasting with the warm, dim amber of a single surviving streetlamp, all set against a palette of desaturated concrete grays and muted asphalt. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev"
